             Since I was a kid I have been fascinated by computers. Being a first generation student in my family and being one of the few that spoke English meant
             I had to do all of my parent's logistics on the computer for them.
             I eventually wanted to learn how all these amazing devices are able to do everything I can for my parents.

                      I did not have many opportunities to learn on my own till my high school offered a computer science course my junior year.
                      I got into the course, struggled miserably with java, failed countless times, barely got a B in the class, and failed the AP exam.
                      But this sparked a curiosity and a flame in me that I had never felt with any other subject

                      5 Years Later I graduated with a degree in Information Technology from UCF and I am pursing a Master's in Computer Science.
                      Still striving to learn more about algorithms, compilers, and math that 16 year old me could have never dreamed of.
